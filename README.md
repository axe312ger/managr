[WIP] Managr.js can be used to make directories on any kind of storage accessible to the web. It can be extended to provide useful tools like markdown editors, photo editors or other js based tools to manipulate files.

## About

Managr tries to be a hackable file manager based on common web standards, libraries and techniques. The core is designed as minimal implementation for a flexible CRUD file api. The datasource might be anything from the local file system to cloud storages or git repositories.

Developer freedom and full configurability is a main goal for managr. Expect for the file api, managr does implement any custom coding patterns which would force developers to drop their own coding preferences and style.

The following web standards are used:
* Websockets
* Stream based data transportation
* Grid layout with fallback to flexbox

Build with these broadly used libraries:
* react
* redux
* webpack with effective chunking and async loading
